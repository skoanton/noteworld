# NoteApp

NoteApp is a secure and encrypted note-taking application that allows users to store and manage notes privately and safely. All notes are encrypted to ensure data security.

## Features

- **Encrypted Notes** – All notes are stored in an encrypted format to ensure privacy and security.
- **Assigned Accounts** – Users cannot create their own accounts; accounts must be assigned by an administrator.
- **Upcoming AI Integration** – Planned functionality where AI can analyze and provide insights based on your notes.
- **Improved UI** – Ongoing work to enhance the user interface and user experience.

   ```
3. Install dependencies:
